# Doc Link Checker

[![CI](https://github.com/djmattyg007/doc-link-checker/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/djmattyg007/doc-link-checker/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

Doc Link Checker is designed to verify links in your documentation. Primarily, this is targeted at
verifying internal (relative) references, to ensure broken links are detected early.

At the moment the detection is limited to links and definitions in markdown files only. Future
support for images and link references is planned, as well as reStructured Text support.
